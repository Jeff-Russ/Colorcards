Colorcards is a WordPress Plugin / Theme pair for styling your WordPress sites and individual posts via Shortcodes. The plugin contains much of the functional part of CSS and JavaScript whereas the Theme fills in more visual details capturing the feel of naturally aged paper. Textures and shadows are everywhere but are so subtle they are nearly subliminal.  

Future plans involve expanding to a modular set Themes and Plugins all working with the same set of CSS classes. Each Theme can work with any Plugin and visa versa, where the choice of theme will be a way to change to alternate coloring and layout options.  

Refer the the individual README.md's in component's directory for further information.
