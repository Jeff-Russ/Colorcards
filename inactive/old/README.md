# Jeffpack for WordPress

![current cycle: development](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.shared/git-status-badges/current_cycle-development-yellow.svg)  

Jeffpack is a collection of WordPress Plugins and Themes. More accurately, Jeffpack is a WordPress Plugin that serves as an entry point to install and update Themes and other Plugins. The list of what is available defaults to those hosts at `https://github.com/Jeff-Russ/` but this can be changed or added to, effectively making Jeffpack a custom source loader.
